# 📄 RAG Document Q&A with Query Expansion, RRF Hybrid Reranking & Session Memory

An end-to-end **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system built with:
- **LangChain**
- **Ollama LLMs + Embeddings**
- **Chroma Vector DB (persistent storage)**
- **Cross-Encoder + BM25 hybrid reranker (RRF)**
- **Multi-query expansion** for better recall
- **Session memory (chat history)** to keep context across turns
- **Streamlit UI** for interactive Q&A

---

## ✨ Features
✅ Upload any **PDF document**  
✅ Automatic **text extraction, cleaning, and chunking**  
✅ **Persistent ChromaDB collections** (no repeated embedding on reload)  
✅ **Multi-query expansion** → improves recall  
✅ **Hybrid Reranking (RRF)** → combines **Cross-Encoder (dense)** + **BM25 (sparse)** for better results  
✅ **RunnableWithMessageHistory memory** → remembers your conversation in-session  
✅ Simple & clean **Streamlit UI** with expansions, top chunks, and final grounded answer

## 🏗️ Architecture Flow

PDF File --> Preprocessing --> Persistent Chroma --> Query Input --> Query Expansion --> Multi-Retriever --> RRF Hybrid Rerank --> LLM --> Final Response

## 🎛️ Usage

1. **Upload a PDF** → text will be extracted, cleaned, chunked, and embedded.

   * Collection is persisted in `./db` (named after the file).
   * On re-upload, system **reuses embeddings** (no repeated computation).

2. **Ask a Question** →

   * System will generate paraphrases of your query.
   * Retrieve chunks with Chroma (dense), expand recall with BM25, then rerank via **RRF (Cross-Encoder + BM25)**.
   * Answer strictly from context.

3. **Conversation Memory** →

   * System remembers your previous questions & answers in the current session.
   * You’ll see the **chat history** at the bottom.
